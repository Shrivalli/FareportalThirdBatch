.NET framework - 2019 - latest version - 4.72 - windows os
.NET core - 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 5.0,6.0 and 7.0 - windows, mac, linux os

Types of Projects/Applications:
1. Desktop apps - console (without GUI) / windows(wpf) - with GUI
2. Web apps - client, server
3. mobile apps - xamarin 

what is .NET core - framework

1. platform - develop, compile, execute the projects
2. BCL - base class libraries 
3. CLR - Common Language Runtime 
4. Programming Languages - C#.NET, VB.NET, F#.NET

C# source code --> C# compiler --> MSIL/CIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language)--> CLR
VB source code --> VB compiler --> MSIL/CIL --> CLR (JIT compiler) --> Native code --> OS

.NET core does not support pointers and multiple inheritance
Memory management is taken care by CLR

Managed code - Codes that can be managed by CLR.
Unmanaged code - CLR does not take the responsibility of these unmanaged codes.

CLS - Common Language specification - set of rules that any language as a part of 
.net family should follow
CTS - Common Type System -
int i;
i:number 
Dim i as integer
integer i;

To create a new project in .NET core:
1. dotnet new console --name firstconsoleapp

source code --> compile(syntax error is checked) --> build (dependencies are linked)
--> executed 

2. dotnet build - compiles and builds our project
bin folder is getting created after build is successful.

3. dotnet run - to execute the output of the project

object is the datatype in which all other datatypes can be stored without conversion.

Type conversions:
1. Implicit - int --> float (automatically) 
2. Explicit - float --> int ( loss of data)
3. Boxing - convert a value type to a reference type 
4. UnBoxing - convert a reference type to a value type

Datatypes in .NET core 
1. int, float, datetime, bool, struct, enum - value types
2. string, object, class, delegates, interface - reference types

int i=10;
string s="Ram"; --> s contains the address of the memory which holds Ram
Eg: Console.ReadLine() --> returns string --> int, bool, datetime, float --> Unboxing

In a solution, there can be multiple projects
In a project, there can be multiple namespaces
In a namespace, there can be multiple classes,.....

1. create a console app in c# to get three marks and calculate the average.
If avg is between 40 and 50 - pass
50 - 60 - average
60-70- good
70-80 - excellent
80-100- outstanding
using if else

2. create a console app in c# to get the age of a person
and print senior citizen if above 60
adult - 30 - 60
youngster - 15-30
child - below 15
using switch case
